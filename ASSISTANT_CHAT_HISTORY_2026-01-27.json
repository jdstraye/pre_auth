  "summary": "Session covers PDF extraction improvements, F1 score tracking, and troubleshooting run_intensive_search.py. User and assistant discussed how to recover improvement ideas, re-run intensive search, and debug a KeyError in the pipeline. Session state and next steps were also saved in pdf_extract.git/ASSISTANT_SESSION_STATE.json.",
  "key_points": [
    "Goal: Improve F1 score by enhancing PDF extraction and other pipeline steps.",
    "Assistant suggested checking TODO.md, README.md, and script comments for improvement ideas.",
    "User requested to re-run run_intensive_search.py for latest F1 score.",
    "Script failed with KeyError: 'mean_f1' (missing column in output DataFrame).",
    "Assistant recommended debugging DataFrame output and checking recent pipeline changes.",
    "Session state was previously saved in pdf_extract.git/ASSISTANT_SESSION_STATE.json for cross-repo continuity."
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Debug why 'mean_f1' is missing in run_exhaustive_search.py output.",
    "Add print statements to inspect DataFrame columns and head before sorting.",
    "Fix column naming or aggregation as needed, then re-run intensive search.",
    "Once fixed, use new F1/candidate results to suggest further improvements."
