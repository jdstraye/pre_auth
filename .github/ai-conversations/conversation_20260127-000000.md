# Conversation Summary (2026-01-27)

## Main Topics
- Schema patching for classifier-aware feature selection and integer label mappings in column_headers.json
- Ensured all label mappings for categoricals are integer-valued (final_contract_status, final_contract_tier, etc.)
- Confirmed use_* flags, X, Y, and categorical flags are present and correct
- No further string-to-integer label mapping fixes needed
- Ready for code and test updates for dynamic classifier-aware feature selection

## Key Decisions
- All major label mappings now use integers
- OHE columns and derived columns are structured correctly
- No further schema fixes needed for label mappings

## Next Steps
- Update code for dynamic classifier-aware feature selection
- Add pytests to confirm classifier-aware column selection and label encoding

## Status for Next Assistant
- Schema is now consistent and robust for all major ML model types
- Proceed with code and test updates as described above
