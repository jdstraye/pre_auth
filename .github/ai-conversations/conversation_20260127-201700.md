# AI Conversation Summary — 2026-01-27 20:17:00

## Summary
- **Goal:** Certainty and test coverage for dynamic, classifier-aware column selection in ML pipelines, with robust schema/code for all major model types, and strict test validation.
- **Key Accomplishments:**
  - Updated schema and code to use only `use_RF` for RandomForestClassifier.
  - Patched tests and data generation to use integer values for categoricals, resolving sklearn conversion errors.
  - Ensured all warnings/issues in tests are treated as failures.
  - Added debug output and robust logic for classifier-aware feature selection.
  - Confirmed all tests pass with strict validation.
- **Final Obstacle:** Test data for categoricals used string values; switching to integers resolved the issue for RF classifiers.

## Key Decisions
- Only `use_RF` is used for RandomForestClassifier; `use_RandomForestClassifier` is not supported.
- Test data for categoricals must use integer values for sklearn compatibility.
- Tests must fail on any warning or issue, not just errors.

## Main Steps
1. Updated schema and loader logic for classifier-aware feature selection.
2. Patched tests to use only `use_RF` and generate valid test data.
3. Added debug output to trace column selection and DataFrame construction.
4. Fixed test data to use integers for categoricals.
5. Verified all tests pass with strict validation.

## Next Steps
- Continue with regular git maintenance and documentation updates as needed.
