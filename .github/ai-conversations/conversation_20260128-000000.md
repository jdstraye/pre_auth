# Conversation Summary: January 28, 2026

## Summary
This conversation focused on diagnosing and improving an ML pipeline for credit factor extraction and classification. Key topics included handling high correlation errors, improving F1 scores, understanding output files, and best practices for chat and git history preservation. The user also requested guidance on sorting CSV results and preserving AI interaction history.

## Main Topics
- Diagnosing high correlation errors in feature selection
- Improving F1 scores through sample size and feature engineering
- Understanding the meaning of mean_f1 and test_f1 in search_results.csv
- Sorting and analyzing model results in CSV files
- Suggestions for further model improvement
- Best practices for chat and git commit history preservation

## Key Decisions
- Confirmed that mean_f1 is the CV average and test_f1 is the test set result
- Provided corrected commands for sorting CSV files by test_f1
- Outlined actionable suggestions for model improvement
- Reiterated the importance of preserving chat and git commit history

## Preservation Best Practices
- Save chat history in `.github/ai-conversations/` as `conversation_{timestamp}.md`
- Include a summary, clear headings, and sections
- Commit and push markdown files after each interaction
- Use targeted git add/commit with descriptive messages
- Push commits to remote for full tracking

## [Chronological Exchanges]
- Diagnosed why *_Status columns (object dtype) are not excluded from ML features.
- Patched feature selection logic to exclude raw *_Status columns from features.
- Re-ran scripts/run_intensive_search.py to confirm fix and derive new classifier.
- Patched run_exhaustive_search.py to handle missing search_results.csv gracefully.
- Debugged output writing for search_results.csv after a successful pipeline run.
- Confirmed robust error handling for missing/empty output files.
