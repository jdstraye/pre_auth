# Conversation Summary: January 28, 2026

## Main Topics
- Diagnosed and fixed ML pipeline issues related to NaNs and object dtypes in *_Status columns.
- Patched feature selection logic to exclude *_Status columns from ML features.
- Improved data cleaning: imputation, type coercion, and robust output handling.
- Debugged and patched output writing for search_results.csv in the hyperparameter search pipeline.
- Ensured robust error handling for missing or malformed output files.

## Key Decisions
- Exclude *_Status columns from ML features to prevent object dtype issues.
- Patch output handling to avoid crashes when search_results.csv is missing or lacks expected columns.
- Prioritize robust, deterministic data cleaning and output writing for ML pipeline stability.

## Chronological Review
1. Diagnosed ML fitting failures due to NaNs and object dtypes.
2. Patched data cleaning and feature selection logic.
3. Re-ran intensive search script; output file search_results.csv missing or malformed.
4. Patched output handling for missing/empty search_results.csv.
5. Confirmed pipeline runs to completion; output file issue remains.

## Next Steps
- Continue debugging why search_results.csv is not being written or is malformed.
- Ensure results are saved in the expected format for downstream ranking and analysis.

## [Summary]
(See summary section above for a detailed breakdown of the session.)

## [Chronological Exchanges]
- Diagnosed why *_Status columns (object dtype) are not excluded from ML features.
- Patched feature selection logic to exclude raw *_Status columns from features.
- Re-ran scripts/run_intensive_search.py to confirm fix and derive new classifier.
- Patched run_exhaustive_search.py to handle missing search_results.csv gracefully.
- Debugged output writing for search_results.csv after a successful pipeline run.
- Confirmed robust error handling for missing/empty output files.
